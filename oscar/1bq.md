## Why Oscar
Firstly, I think the current insurance system is not great, I am enrolled in Columbia Insurance Plan
, which is not only expensive but also very complex. Therefore,
I would like to join in Oscar Health in order to 
provide users with simple, transparent and humanized insurance.

Besides, I know Oscar Health is growing rapidly,
and there are a lot of talented engineers from many
giant technology companies. Therefore, I think I could learn a lot and
work on the projects that not only excites myself but also drive meaningful and real-world impact.
